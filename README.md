**A Tsundere Christmas Carol** is a heartwarming anime parody comic posted every Christmas Eve to 4chan's /a/ since 2011.

A Ren'Py visual novel rendition of this story has been worked on [since 2011.](http://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=13155) After the huge publicity following the [2014 /a/ sticky](https://archive.moe/a/thread/118778767), the author decided to rush and release a finalized 1.0 version. The author is anonymous, but seems to have named themselves VNAnon. Thanks a lot, man.

To preserve this impressive work of art for *Christmas future*, this visual novel and it's source code has been archived by the [Bibliotheca Anonoma](http://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki) and can be downloaded from this *unofficial* Github repository.

## Source Code

The source code in this repository contains the game files and scripts. Note that you must add your own Ren'Py runtime libraries (and point it at the `game` folder) to actually play the game.

Since it uses Ren'Py, a crafty dev can probably use the source code in this repository to create an **Android, iPhone**, or even OpenPandora port. We recommend [RAPT](http://github.com/renpy/rapt) for Android.

### Message to the Author

The Bibliotheca Anonoma specializes in archiving software projects and creating their websites, documentation, and source code repositories.

However, we would prefer to pass the repository on to the original author, and educate devs how to maintain the repo and the website. Successful examples include the [Hydrus Tagging System](http://github.com/hydrusnetwork/hydrus/).

However, you'd have to figure out a way to prove that you made it somehow... I assume that the author also made [My Little Dictator?](http://mylittledictator.wordpress.com/) I don't know.

Just get a Github account, [open an issue on this repository](https://github.com/bibanon/a-tsundere-christmas-carol/issues) and make a claim. We'd be glad to help.

For 4chan projects like this, we recommend [the WTFPL license.](http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/)
