**A Tsundere Christmas Carol** is a heartwarming anime parody comic posted every Christmas Eve to 4chan's /a/ since 2011.

A Ren'Py visual novel rendition of this story has been worked on [since 2011.](http://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=13155) After the huge publicity following the [2014 /a/ sticky](https://archive.moe/a/thread/118778767), the author decided to rush and release a finalized 1.0 version. The author is anonymous, but seems to have named themselves VNAnon. Thanks a lot, man.

To preserve this impressive work of art for *Christmas future*, this visual novel and it's source code has been archived by the [Bibliotheca Anonoma](http://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki) and can be downloaded from this Github repository.

## Downloads

If you just want to play the visual novel, download the full executable from Github Releases below:

* v1.0
  * [Windows]()
  * [Mac OS X]()
  * [Linux]()

## Source Code

The source code in this repository contains the game files and scripts. Note that you must add your own Ren'Py runtime libraries (and point it at the `game` folder) to actually play the game.

Since it uses Ren'Py, a crafty dev can probably use the source code in this repository to create an **Android, iPhone**, or even OpenPandora port.
