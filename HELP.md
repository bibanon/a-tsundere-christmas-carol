    :   Switches between fullscreen and windowed mode.
    Transitions
    :   Controls the display of transitions between game screens.
    Text Speed
    :   Controls the rate at which text displays. The further to the
        right this slider is, the faster the text will display. All the
        way to the right causes text to be shown instantly.

    :   Lets you control the game using a joystick.

    After Choices
    :   Controls if skipping stops upon reaching a menu.
    Auto-Forward Time
    :   Controls automatic advance. The further to the left this slider
        is, the shorter the amount of time before the game advances. All
        the way to the right means text will never auto-forward.
    Music, Sound, and Voice Volume

        channels, respectively. The further to the right these are, the
        louder the volume.
